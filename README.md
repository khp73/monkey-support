FAQ

**Is this a replacement for Greasemoneky-like extensions?**

No, because it does not support the non-standard JavaScript features used by such extensions (aka GM API).

Part of GM API may be compatible with polyfill in the future.

**Why develop this extension?**

In order to execute simple userscripts on mobile browsers.

Existing Greasemoneky-like extensions are not optimized for mobile browsers.
